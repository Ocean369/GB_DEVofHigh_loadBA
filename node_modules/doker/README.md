Introduction
============

**Doker** is a Node.js/io.js library that allows to write large multipage PDF-documents using CoffeeScript and Markdown. The word _**doker**_ is a portmanteau of _**do**cument_ and _ma**ker**_. The main objective is to provide high level functionality allowing to generate rich and interactive documents. Our approach combines power and flexibility of programming techniques with extremely simple and readable syntax.

**Doker** is based on amazing library called [PDFkit](http://pdfkit.org). We extend possibilities of PDFKit by adding some higher-level functions needed to compose such kind of documents as electronic books, user's manuals, product datasheets etc. Another great library called [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) help us to involve Markdown syntax into process of content creation.
